									<h2>What is Biohacking(AI) ?</h2>

<p>Biohacking could be a next big thing in this smart world. The big question about biohacking is, what is it?  Biohacking is a fairly new practice that could lead to major changes in our life. You could it call citizen or do-it-your-self biology. Biohacking” is a term that’s floating around with increasing regularity. It’s defined as a sort of citizen biology; most of the work is done in small, independent labs by people in their spare time, mucking about with things like modifying plant DNA to impact growth or isolating certain genetic material to enhance or improve on it. And that’s basic idea of movement—improving on biological entities, sort of like upgrading your computer.</p>
 


<p>Biohacking venues are popping up around the world, giving people all the tools they need to start exploring their world in a very biological and sometimes terrifying way. Critics point out that word “Hack” was always a threatening, illegal thing. Even though it’s mostly an expression of curiosity, some really weird things have come out of the movement</p>

<p>Some good things you should know about Biohacking. Biohacking doesn’t have to alter DNA or genetic material. It can also combine technology with the biological along the lines of Kevin Warwick’s vision. The people that do it are called “grinders.” One of the first examples of this was the insertion of magnets into a person’s fingertips. Not surprisingly, it’s a rather underground movement, and it’s usually done in places like body modification shops and piercing parlors. </p>

<p>Implanting magnets in someone’s fingertips isn’t just about using them to pick things up. According to those that have it done, the human body gradually adapts to having the magnet in place and starts to read the signals it receives as though it’s just another biological part of the body. They liken it to wearing glasses and your body adjusting to them while your senses are heightened. Just what kind of impact modifications like these will have on those that get them remains to be seen. While some claim to be able to use the magnets implanted in their bodies like an extra sense, others claim that the feeling fades within a few weeks, and you’re just left with the neat party trick of being able to use the Force on a very small scale.</p>

<p>But, Biohacking is already becoming common in Russia. It has been reported that a Siberian doctor has already implanted not one, but at least six microchips underneath his skin and turned his body into a multi-functional gadget for doing a number of jobs by just a wave of his hands.</p>

<p>Alexander Volchek, who is an obstetrician / gynaecologist in a hospital in the Novosibirsk region in Russia's north, got his first microchip implant in 2014 and since then he acquired a few more and now has a total of six chips under his skin.</p>

<p>However, Volchek does not want to stop here and hopes to implant a cryptosystem and a glucometer microchip in his body in the near future.</p>

<p>These chips help him perform day-to-day activities just by moving his hand over a bar code scanner, such as opening doors at work and home, paying bills with a wave of his hand-everything works like magic.

•	Two chip to enter his office
•	One transport chip
•	Two memory cards for storing almost a kilobyte of information
•	One control card for a Siberian ski resort
</p>

<p>A syringe with a thick needle is required to inject a microchip, whose standard size is 2x12mm, and minimum size is no more than 1.5x8mm with storage capacity ranges from 800 bytes to 1 kilobyte of information.</p>

<p>One of the microchips serves as Volchek's business card, while another one stores his password, allowing him to unlock his computer.

However, the microchips are not permanently implanted into the skin. They can be easily extracted from the body whenever the user wants to get rid of it.
</p>

<p>While the Biometric technology is experiencing an increase in popularity, it also raises widespread concerns about the safety and privacy of people adopting it.

Hackers could misuse this technology against the public itself, and one should not forget that with the advance in technology, the techniques leveraged by hackers and cyber criminals also improves.
</p>
<p>Over two years ago, a hacker implanted a small NFC chip in his hand to  hack android smartphone and bypass almost all security measures, demonstrating the risks of Biohacking.

At the end of the same year, another hacker managed to implant a small NFC chip with the private key to his Bitcoin wallet underneath his skin, allowing him to buy groceries or transfer money between bank accounts just by waving his hand.
